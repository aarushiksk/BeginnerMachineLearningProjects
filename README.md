<br></br>

*Import basic libraries like numpy, pandas and scikit-learn.*<br>

*Import the datasets*<br>

*Perform exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on the datasets, to understand and visualize the data better, using libraries like seaborn and matplotlib.*<br>

*Choose your model/ algorithm according to the dataset and your requirement.*<br>

*Adjust the parameters/estimators.*<br>

*Evaluate your model by using libraries like mean_squared_error, r2_score, sklearn.metrics etc.*<br>

*Integrate the model your model with a website or an app.*<br>
